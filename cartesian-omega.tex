\title[A theory of weak $\omega$-categories]{A homotopy theory of weak $\omega$-categories}
\author[H. Gindi]{Harry Gindi}
\date{\today}
\begin{abstract} In this paper, we consider the model structure on the category of cellular sets originally conjectured by Cisinski and Joyal to give a model for the homotopy theory of weak \(\omega\)-categories.  We demonstrate first that any \(\Theta\)-localizer containing the spine inclusions \(\iota: \Sp[t] \hookrightarrow \Theta[t]\) must also contain the maps \(X\times \iota: X\times \Sp[t] \hookrightarrow X\times \Theta[t]\) for all objects \([t]\) of \(\Theta\)  and all cellular sets \(X\).  This implies in particular that a cellular set \(S\) is local with respect to the set of spine inclusions if and only if it is Cartesian-local.  However, we show that the minimal localizer containing the spine inclusions is not stable under two-point suspension, which implies that the equivalences between objects fibrant for this model structure only depend on their height-\(0\) and height-\(1\) structure.  We then try to see if adopting an approach similar to Rezk's, namely looking at all of the suspensions of the inclusion of a point into a freestanding isomorphism. We call the fibrant objects for this model structure \dfn{isostable Joyal-fibrant} cellular sets.  We understand the resulting model structure to be conjectured by a few mathematicians to give a model structure for a category of weak \(\omega\)-categories.  However, we make short work of this claim by producing an explicit example of a nontrivial contractible cofibrant strict \(\omega\)-category (with respect to the folk model structure) and showing that it is, first, not trivially fibrant, and second, proving that it is fibrant with respect to the isostable Joyal model structure.  We finally restart our approach from the beginning; bruised and battered, but also older and wiser, we construct a conjectural model structure which appears to have all of our desired properties.

\chapter*{Introduction}
Based on the earlier work of Boardman and Vogt, Joyal introduced the theory of quasicategories as a way of dealing with constructions in homotopy theory that were modeled by homotopy-coherent diagrams.  Jacob Lurie then extended much of ordinary category theory to these quasicategories, which he and others have envisioned as a theory of \((\infty,1)\)-categories. However, as the theory of \((\infty,1)\)-categories became more and more well-understood, it became clear that it was perhaps less interesting than had been previously suspected, One major problem with the theory is that much of the richness we would expect in a theory of higher categories was simply not present. Limits and colimits are defined using cocones and cones.  Arrows that are equivalences are parameterized by maps out of the nerve of a freestanding isomorphism.  We have no notions of laxness, and we even have the property that every weighted limit or colimit can be obtained as the conical limit of an easily modified diagram.   

Moreover, since the notion of an \((\infty,2)\)-category is not a priori defined, we can't perform (homotopy coherent) 2-categorical operations on the category of \((\infty,1)\)-categories, which forces us to take the ``local'' view  of important things like Kan extensions, adjunctions, representability, and things that are generally understood using strict 2-categories.  Interesting and important higher-categorical algebraic structures like monads, operads, monoidal products, braiding, symmetry, etc. are shoehorned into what amounts to a ``thickened'' theory of \(1\)-categories, and these kinds of maneuvers make much of the theory unwieldy. 

We give an example of this: To define the Grothendieck correspondence for diagrams of spaces indexed by an \((\infty,1)\)-category, Lurie first obtains a rather large family of simplicial Quillen adjunctions \[\operatorname{St}_\phi:(\psh{\Delta}\downarrow X)_{\operatorname{Dex}} \rightleftarrows  (\psh{\Delta}^{\mathcal{X}})_{\operatorname{Proj}}\] indexed by triples \((X, \phi, \mathcal{X})\) consisting of a simplicial set \(X\), a simplicially enriched category \(\mathcal{X}\), and a map \(\phi:\mathfrak{C}[X]\to \mathcal{X}\).  Lurie shows in \cite{htt} that when this map is a weak equivalence of simplicially enriched categories, the image of the simplicially enriched subjecategory of \((\psh{\Delta}^{\mathcal{X}})_{\operatorname{Proj}}\) spanned by the cofibrant-fibrant objects under the right adjoint \((\operatorname{St}_\phi,\operatorname{Un}_\phi)\) is weakly equivalent as a simplicially enriched category to the simplicially-enriched subcategory of  \(\psh{\Delta}\downarrow X)_{\operatorname{Dex}} \) spanned by its fibrant objects.  Then by a theorem regarding simplicial model categories, this implies that the Quillen adjunction is a Quillen equivalence.  

However, from the point of view of a theory of \((\infty,2)\)-categories, we never really need to leave to an external theory in order to formulate the \((\infty,1)\)-categorical Grothendieck construction.  In fact, we have a number of different ways that we can do it.  One way to do it is to find a fibrant object that models the  \((\infty,1)\)-category of spaces and then either define the grothendieck construction by means of an oplax colimit or by means of the pullback of the generalized universal fibration, which can easily be defined using an (op)lax version of the join construction. However, this leaves us with the problem of how to deal with higher and higher dimensional versions of \((\infty, n)\)-categories to be able to easily perform \(n+1\)-dimensional operations on \((\infty,n)\)-categories.  We should think about the grothendieck construction as encoding \(n+1\)-dimensional data as \(n\)-dimensional data.  

Then to be able to formalize everything in a single theory, we're forced to consider the case where \(n\) is infinite.  In this paper, we will consider a number of candidates for a homotopy theory that encodes these ideas.  Ultirmately, we will show that the model structure proposed by Cisinski and Joyal doesn't quite pass muster, since it does not satisfy the expected stability property (namely that the two-point suspension of a Cisinski-Joyal weak equivalence need not be a weak equivalence).  However, we can use some of the tools developed in the first chapter to obtain a ``stabilized'' form of this theory.  Moreover, we show that both the original form and its stabilized counterpart are cartesian-closed model structures.  That is, it is a theorem of Cisinski that the minimal Cisniski model structure on a presheaf category is generated by choosing the cylinder functor to be the cartesian product with the subobject classifier.  This model structure is obviously cartesian-closed, by construction.  We then include the spine inclusion maps as weak equivalences, which generate the Cisinski-Joyal model structure and show that these also generate a cartesian model structure.   Finally, the stabilization of this model structure under the categorical two-point suspension functor is proven to be be cartesian closed.

We recently became aware of independent work reaching similar conclusions about the conjecture of Cisinski and Joyal through somewhat different methods by Dimitri Ara \cite{ara-new}.  While we provide a sequence of counterexamples in each higher dimension, he proves very generally that the suspension of any map belonging to a general class of weak equivalences in the \(\infty,n\)-case of the conjecture fails to a weak equivalence, and to rectify this, echoing Rezk, he proposes a small family of generating weak equivalences in order to rectify the problem.  

The author would like to give special thanks to Denis-Charles Cisinski for his invaluable guidance and mentorship, as well as for his help in formulating parts of \eqref{sec:cishelp}, to David Oury for his lively correspondence and his continued interest in our work, and finally, to Richard Steiner, whose tireless work in the area of pasting theory has given us a better understanding of the lax tensor product than we ever even thought was reasonable.
